"Scoped BASIC" is the BASIC-like scripting language.
This repository is the interpreter for Scoped BASIC.
It was made by Kazh. at Security & Programming Camp 2011, IPA.

Required:
  ruby
  racc

------
Scoped BASIC designed not to need Complex Sentence, For Syntax, While Syntax, Sub Routine Syntax, and other Control Syntax.

Operators)
  +         Add
  -         Substract
  *         Multiply
  /         Divide
  %, Mod    Modulo
  &         Cast something to String and Concat Strings

Environment Variable)
  stree     If it is 0, syntax trees will not be printed.
  echo      If it is 0, return values will not be printed.

For example)
;Print Strings
print("Hogehoge\n") ;=> Hogehoge
print(&3, "\n")     ;=> 3     (monomial& operator is abbreviation of `"" &`
                    ;Monomal& operator means specified casting into string

;False complex sentence
cond(print("a"):() print("b"):() print("c"):() else:(print("\n")))

;Factorial
fact = ^(n)(cond(n==0:(1)else:(n*fact(n-1))))
print(&fact(5), "\n") ;=> 120

;Lambda Calculus
plusX = ^(X)(^(n)(n+X))
plusFive = plusX(5)
print(&plusFive(3),"\n") ;=>8 (3+5=8

call = ^(func, arg)(func(arg))
hoge = ^(x)(print(x,"\n"))
call(hoge, 3) ;=>3
